                    The blue whale have a carnivore diet, but despite of their size, these <br>
                    massive sea creatures prefer to eat some of the tiniest marine life. <br>
                    Blue Whales <span>feast on plankton called krill,</span> which is a <br>
                    small animal that resembles shrimp. Due to the relative sizes of both <br>
                    the blue whale and krill, they can consume as many as 40 million krill, <br>
                    or 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) of it daily.
